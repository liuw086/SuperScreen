Super Screen offers VR users a unique and immersive viewing experience. This application creates virtual environments such as cinemas and classrooms within VR, offering users a mixed reality (MR) experience that blends the virtual and real worlds. It supports various video formats including 2D, 3D, 180-degree, and 360-degree videos, and can play videos in resolutions up to 8K, ensuring an ultimate visual experience. Users can also conveniently share media files from computers within the same local area network to their VR devices. Currently, the video formats are limited to mp4 and mkv, but more types are being developed for future versions.

A notable feature of Super Screen is its multi-platform support, including PC operating systems like Windows and Mac, allowing users to stream video content from their PCs to the big screen in their VR device. This cross-platform capability makes Super Screen suitable not just for entertainment purposes, like watching movies, but also for educational and business environments, such as virtual classrooms and meeting rooms. In education, it offers students a more immersive learning experience; in business, it can be used for virtual meetings, providing a more interactive and immersive meeting experience. Streaming support for the Linux platform is currently under development and will be available in future versions.
